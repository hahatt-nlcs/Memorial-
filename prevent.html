    <h1>How Can We Prevent Another Holocaust?</h1>
    <p>Young people are the future. We are the last generation who can meet Holocaust survivors in person. That means itâ€™s our job to carry their stories forward. Most young people today grow up online. That means we need ways to remember the Holocaust that fit into how we live and learn. 
    Technology can help bring memory into our world and teach it.This could teach the younger generation the dangers of hate and prejudice, what happens when people stay silent and why we face new waves of hatred and denial.

    <p>Nevertheless, from the past years, decoupling and deglobalization had been a common action. Throughout that, the right wing and far right wing begin to gain power and support. 
    This also enhanced the importance of learning the history of holocaust to prevent it from happening again under these conditions.
    Overall, Digitalize helps make Holocaust education more accessible, engaging, and accessible for a new generation since sadly Holocaust survivors are slowly fading.
