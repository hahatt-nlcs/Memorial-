    <p>The Holocaust was the state-sponsored persecution and murder of six million Jews by the Nazi regime and its allies between 1933 and 1945. Millions of others — including Roma, disabled individuals, Poles, Soviet prisoners of war, and political dissidents — were also victims of this genocidal campaign.</p>

    <h2>The Machinery of Hate</h2>
    <p>From 1941 to 1945, the Nazi regime orchestrated a systematic attempt to annihilate entire populations based on race, religion, and ethnicity. Over six million Jews and millions of others were brutally murdered. This genocide began not in gas chambers, but with words, laws, and propaganda. Holocaust, one of the worst events that humans had ever created, was to systematically remove racially, religiously and ethnicity different groups of people from 1941 to 1945. This had caused more than 6 million of Jews, minority groups, political opponents to be killed and brutally tortured. </p>

    <h2>Why We Remember</h2>
    <p>Jewish families were forced from their homes. Communities were destroyed. Children were separated from their parents. The world watched in silence for too long. The Holocaust teaches us about the consequences of prejudice and the importance of standing up against injustice — in every generation.</p>
